This directory is for separating out resources into separate subclasses.

Refer to [this guide](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/modules1.html#manifests-namespacing-and-autoloading) before randomly naming files though
(**HINT**: Filenames ARE important and DO matter here)

There's a handy 'applications.pp' included to get you started.
